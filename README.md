**I chose golden apples, so it is not possible to craft an infinite amount of spawners.**

_If you want spawners to be really OP, you can download my_ [Craft Enchanted Golden Apple](https://modrinth.com/datapack/craft-enchanted-golden-apple) _datapack/mod_

_To actually spawn something with the spawner, you can download my_ [Craft Spawn Eggs](https://modrinth.com/datapack/craft-spawn-eggs) _datapack/mod_
